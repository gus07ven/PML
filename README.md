This repository contains code for multiple machine learning projects:

1. Graduate Machine Learning - "A Survey of Supervised Learning Classifiers": 
In this project, we implemented and compared the performance of several supervised learning classifiers using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. For a detailed explanation of the results please see the ML_Final_Project.pdf file in this repository. 

2. Graduate Advanced Machine Learning - "A Combination of Local Models for Active Learning":
This project shows a novel way to combine local classification models to produce an accurate global classifier for active learning. Our results show increased classification performance using versus an existing active learning platform. For a detailed explanation of the research and results please see Advanced_ML_Final_Project_Report.pdf file in this repository.
